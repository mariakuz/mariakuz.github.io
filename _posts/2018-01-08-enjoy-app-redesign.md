summary: Reducing friction for "smart last mile" of electronics purchases.

As part of my KPCB Design Fellowship application, I redesigned part of the Enjoy app.

### Process
* Interviewed Clark to understand employee perspective
* Research on checkout process and company
* Grouped scenarios and visualized workflow
* Looked at points of failure and picked one to address
* Generated potential solutions
* Selection of an idea and prototyping
* Analyzed, tested, and reflected on solution

### Thoughts

With two weeks to conduct research and execute, I found it difficult to find a sample size large enough. Since much of the Enjoy process is contained within the Enjoy employee app, I would love to shadow an Enjoy employee to get a better look behind the scenes and learn from an actual purchase.

I would also love to test this idea and get feedback from Experts. I was able to get Clark's feedback - reduce the amount of text - but he's only one person.

I chose to go with an email due to its ease of implementation into the current workflow and low level of effort required from the customer. Based on the diagram I had made, it was one of the solutions that did the most to correct the information imbalance in the process.

Another idea that I considered and ultimately discarded was creating an Enjoy Outpost or office hours where people could go to a local coffee shop to troubleshoot issues. While similar to the WeWork/Samsung collaboration, this one could be mobile and change locations from week-to-week as needed to address demand.
