summary: Paving my own path at CWRU.
---
As of 2018, CWRU has granted four custom minors in the last decade, with the latest addition being Product Design. Combining classes in systems theory, information design, marketing, and biodesign, the minor filled a unique gap at an engineering school. And it's something I made up because I was curious.

After taking introductory classes in marketing and information systems, I followed my interests to graduate-level courses in biodesign and information design. Finding no other way to pursue my interests, I worked with Richard Buchanan to develop an independent study into the systems connecting food, stewardship, and reverance.

Despite the institution's initial hesitance to create a unique offering, I was granted the minor, the first unrelated to the language programs; the minor program was intended for language classes with reduced class offerings.

Since graduation, many students have reached out to learn how they, too, can minor in product design. One of those students has created her own major in Human-Computer Interaction.

While I wish I'd had more ways to explore the HCI/product/systems space during my undergraduate career, I'm glad that future students will have the opportunity to do so!
