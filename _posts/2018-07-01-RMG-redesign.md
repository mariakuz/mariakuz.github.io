summary: Website redesign for a marketing agency.
---
I worked with DepUp, a departments-as-a-service startup in Cleveland. Within the span of five hours, I researched and redesigned a website for RMG Dallas, a marketing agency for small businesses.

### Process

#### Research + ideation
After reviewing the current site, I mapped out the information architecture, then generated new ways to display content and highlight projects.

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/20180616_123159.JPG"/> <br/>
</div>
<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/20180616_123315.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><br/>

<div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_1.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><!--
--><div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_2.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><br/>
<div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_3.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><!--
--><div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_4.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><br/>

#### Idea generation + documentation
I combined elements with new information architecture to create new site layouts.

<div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_5.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><!--
--><div class = "post-image cover">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hour_1_6.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><br/>

#### Element definition
After documenting the existing text styles, I adjusted colors for WCAG-compliance and increased contrast.

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="" src= "/images/rmg/RMG_hi_fi_wireframe_styles.JPG"/> <br/>
</div><br/>

#### Element creation
I created new graphics where necessary and wrote copy as needed for stand in.

### Results
I delivered hourly updates and presented a high-fidelity wireframe based off of the agency's chosen low-fidelity design.

</div><br/>
### Thoughts
In this model, I didn't work with the client as closely as I wanted to, and the short turn around meant that some of my questions I had to answer myself.
