As part of the Spring 21 Experiential Futures class, my group developed a scenario based on the Technology Futures report published by the World Economic Forum and Deloitte.

We founded Outliers Data Talent, an agency where candidates vie to sell their personal data to data brokers. ODT served to highlight the societal discomfort with selling all of our data and the extreme lengths people would go to. We created a future where data became exceedingly commodified, taking inspiration from current-day modelling agencies.

After creating individual "tours" on (the now-deprecated) Google Poly, I combined our work (along with some brand assets and copy) into a company website using Carrd. While the deprecated nature of Poly means those tours are no longer available to view, the rest of [the ODT site](https://outliersdatatalent.carrd.co/) lives on, along with our associated [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OutliersDataTal).
