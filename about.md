Hello! 

I’m M. I’m a product designer who’s technical and systems-oriented. Whatever the medium, I enjoy finding and solving problems that people face and getting involved at all stages of the product design process, from research to implementation. However, I particularly love doing deep dives on literature to collect insights and synthesize solutions and summaries.

#### Questions that I’m thinking about:
- How can we design technologies for an equitable and sustainable future?
- What comes after human-centered design? What are alternatives to conventional design processes?
- How do the human components of systems interface with the non-human? 
- What's the rat techno future?

#### What I'm looking for
I'm currently based in Minneapolis, MN and open to relocating across the US. You might do the product/UI/UX split differently than I do, but I'm looking for job titles such as creative technologist, designer who codes, product designer, and maybe whatever else you're thinking. Let's chat.

I’m interested in technology as it relates to systems, sustainability, and the future of food and have domain experience in bioinformatics/crystallography, healthcare device design, and cryptocurrencies. Any combination works: I'm looking to create thoughtful technology and believe form follows function (and accessible experiences are beautiful).

#### What I've worked on
I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 2018 with a dual degree in computer science and systems biology. I also created and earned CWRU's first minor in product design. I've had the chance to work with companies such as [Google](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2017/09/20/summer-2017.html), [Apple](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2016/08/07/summer-2016.html), and CoinDesk. My experience ranges from refining crystallography data to brand designs to software development, and I'm always looking for a new, interdisciplinary project.

#### What I'm up to
Most recently, I’ve been coding at Target and designing for LGBTQ bike communities, including launching the first agender pride cycling clothing collection. My newsletter, the Finkedin, continues into its third year of exploring emerging technologies and the future. Outside of design/tech, I enjoy culinary projects and riding bikes with the local bike community.
