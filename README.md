# M Kuznetsov : the personal website
### About
If you're here, you're probably looking at my Github. This is the source code for my personal website that I made in 2016 the day before a conference and have been slowly bolting onto over time.

It runs on Jekyll and I write all the posts in Markdown and the CSS is kind of overkill. I'm a React developer now. Maybe at some point I'll change it to a Gatsby site or use some other framework that gets things running quickly in React.

Until then, I'll keep on sporadically updating it every 3 months. 

### Code Examples
I don't code much in my spare time, but if you want examples of my code work, you can take a look in these spots:
- [Room Planner](https://www.target.com/room-planner/nursery) - I've worked as the main React UI engineer on the experience for about two years
- [Virtual Beauty Try-on](https://www.target.com/c/virtual-try-on/-/N-3726b)- I built out a significant chunk of the UI componentry for this AR experience
- [Gender Generator](https://github.com/encoder-rat-decoder-rat/gender-generator) - I helped develop this UI as art generative art piece
